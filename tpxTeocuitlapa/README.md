This language pack has test audio files for its syllables. These test files do not contain any actual audio, so all syllable games (marked 'S' in the games list) will be silent until this audio is recorded properly in the upcoming months. Take a look at the games and get a feel for how these games work, knowing that eventually, the game references (pictures, audio players, syllable tiles) will be clickable and have playable audio.
